# ReRxSwift
![Swift Version 4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-v4-yellow.svg)

*[RxSwift][1] bindings for [ReSwift][2]*

## Notes

1. This is work in progress. Don't use it yet, but stay tuned.
2. If you're feeling adventurous, disregard the first note and please use this by all means! Report issues, submit pull request, etc; you know the drill.
3. This project depends on Swift 4! I am currently using Xcode 9.0 beta 5 and the Swift compiler that comes with it. Earlier Xcode 9.0 betas fail at compiling this project!

## Examples
The folder `Examples` contains the following examples:

- **SimpleTextField**: Most basic use case of ReRxSwift, containing a text field that has its value bound, and an action.
- **SteppingUp**: Use case with multiple bound values and actions, also showing how to transform values when binding them.
